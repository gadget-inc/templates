# Monthly subscription based Shopify app billing

This template has [setup instructions](template-setup).

This template is an example of how to handle monthly subscriptions with a free trial period using the Shopify Billing API. Merchants will be charged based on plans defined by the app developer, on a monthly recurring basis.

Note: Billing is only required for [public Shopify apps](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types).
