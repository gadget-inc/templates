# One-time charge based Shopify app billing

For more information about this template please navigate to the [setup instructions](template-setup).

This template is an example of how to handle one-time charges with a free trial period using the Shopify Billing API. This template follows an Apple App Store style of billing (pay to have full access to features). One-time charges can also be used to charge merchants for access to specific features.

Note: Billing is only required for [public Shopify apps](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types).
