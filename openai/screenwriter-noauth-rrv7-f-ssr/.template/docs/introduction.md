# Screenwriter AI Template

## Core Purpose

This application serves as a powerful template for building AI-powered applications that generate creative text content. It comes pre-configured with an OpenAI connection, allowing you to quickly build features like automated script writing, character dialogue generation, or any other creative writing task.

## Key Functionality

- **AI-powered content generation**: Leverages a built-in OpenAI connection to generate movie scripts, quotes, and other creative text based on user prompts.
- **Real-time streaming**: Includes an example of how to stream AI responses directly to the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Semantic search-ready**: The `movie` model includes a vector field for `embedding`, laying the groundwork for building a semantic search feature to find similar movies based on their quotes or titles.
