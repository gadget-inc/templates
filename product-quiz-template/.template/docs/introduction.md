# Product Recommendation Quiz

Allow merchants to build quizzes that then recommend products to the buyer based on their answers. This app can be embedded into a storefront using Shopify theme app extensions (for themes using Online Store 2.0), or by manually adding Liquid files into their theme. These quizzes engage shoppers by recommending products suited to their needs, enhancing the shopping experience and boosting sales.

The embedded frontend app makes use of Gadget's `useActionForm` hook to manage form state when creating or editing quizzes.
