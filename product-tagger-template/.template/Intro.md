# Template Architecture
This template automates the process of assigning tags to products added to a store's inventory.

The allowedTag and shopifyProduct models manage tag associations and product information. The frontend has ShopPage.jsx, enabling users to add/remove keywords within the app's database. Access control is granted to shopify-app-users for allowedTag operations, ensuring secure administration.
