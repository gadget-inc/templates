# Product recommendation quiz

The application enables store owners to build custom quizzes through the Shopify admin interface. Each quiz consists of multiple questions with various answer options, and merchants can associate specific product recommendations with different answer combinations. When customers take a quiz, their responses are analyzed to generate personalized product suggestions, creating a more engaging and guided shopping experience.

The app includes both an admin interface for merchants to manage their quizzes (create, edit, and configure product mappings) and a customer-facing quiz interface that can be embedded directly into Shopify storefronts via a theme extension. Customer quiz results and product suggestions are tracked, allowing merchants to analyze engagement and optimize their product recommendations over time.
