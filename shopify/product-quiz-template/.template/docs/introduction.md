# Product Recommendation Quiz

Allow merchants to build quizzes that then recommend products to the buyer based on their answers. This app can be embedded into a storefront using Shopify theme app extensions (for themes using Online Store 2.0), or by manually adding Liquid files into their theme. These quizzes engage shoppers by recommending products suited to their needs, enhancing the shopping experience and boosting sales.

The app consists of three main components: (1) a merchant-facing admin interface where store owners can create and manage quizzes, questions, and product recommendations, (2) a customer-facing quiz interface that displays in the storefront, and (3) a results page that shows personalized product recommendations based on customer responses. Merchants can create multiple quizzes with different question sets, allowing them to target specific product categories or customer segments. Each answer can be linked to specific products, creating a tailored shopping experience.

The app leverages Gadget's data model to store quiz structures, questions, answers, and product recommendations. For merchants, the embedded frontend app makes use of Gadget's useActionForm hook to manage form state when creating or editing quizzes. On the customer side, quiz results are stored to track shopper preferences and product suggestions, enabling merchants to analyze customer behavior and optimize their product recommendations over time. This creates a powerful tool for increasing conversion rates while providing genuine value to shoppers through personalized recommendations.
