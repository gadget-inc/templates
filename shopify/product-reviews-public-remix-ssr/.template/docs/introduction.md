# Product Reviews

Core Purpose: This app enables Shopify merchants to collect, manage, and display customer reviews for their products. It provides an automated review collection system that requests feedback from customers after purchase, along with a comprehensive admin interface for review moderation and a storefront display system.

Key Functionality: The app automatically sends review request emails to customers based on configurable timing after order fulfillment. Customers can submit reviews through a secure, code-based system that doesn't require account creation. Merchants can approve or reject reviews through the admin interface, and approved reviews are displayed on product pages via a theme extension. The system syncs review data with Shopify using metafields, maintaining review summaries and ratings directly in the merchant's product catalog for seamless integration with their storefront.
