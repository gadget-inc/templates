# Product reviews

This template has [setup instructions](template-setup).

This template allows merchants to collect and manage reviews for their products, leveraging Shopify's metaobject system for storing review data. Review requests are sent a set number of days after the order is completely fulfilled.

## App flow overview

- A customer places an order from the Shopify storefront
- Once the order is fully fulfilled, a date is set to send a review request email to the customer
- On the designated date, the email is sent
- The customer clicks a button in the email, redirecting them to a page listing their purchased products. Here, they can review each product until all have been reviewed

Once all products are reviewed, the customer may no longer access the page.
