# Getting started

A list of steps that you should follow:

1. [Connect to Shopify](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/tutorials/connecting-to-shopify#connecting-to-shopify) using our built-in Shopify plugin.

2. Sync the code locally using `ggt` ([Gadget CLI](https://docs.gadget.dev/reference/ggt#ggt-reference)) and run `yarn dev` to test the application. Note that you're require to have a `shopify.app.toml` to run `yarn dev`. Make sure to install the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli#installation) using these instructions.

3. Install the application on a development store, and add the extension block to the product page. When testing, make sure that you're always running `yarn dev`.
