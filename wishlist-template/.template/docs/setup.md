## Getting started

A list of steps that you should follow:

1. [Connect to Shopify](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/tutorials/connecting-to-shopify#connecting-to-shopify) using our built-in Shopify plugin.

2. Select [Public distribution](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/distribution) in the "Distribution" tab of the Shopify Partner dashboard.

3. Sync your application's files locally using the [Gadget CLI](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/development-tools/cli). An example command can be found at the top left of the application's Gadget editor.

4. Run `yarn dev` to run the Shopify CLI and connect to the Shopify app created in step 1.

5. Install the application on a development store and create a customer account on the online store. Once this is done, you can step through the application and test the functionality.
